# Day 4 - Bash

## Did I know this language before?
Yes, but not awk

### What's your opinion of this language?
Bash remains OP for how fast it is. awk is crazy

### If not, how hard was it to learn/setup?
N/A

## Thoughts on the Solution?
Part 1 was pretty easy. AWK was basically just copying from reference doc

Part 2 Doing the shifting via bash was super fun. I didn't know that syntax existed previously
