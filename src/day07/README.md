# Day 6 - Objective-C

## Did I know this language before?
No

### What's your opinion of this language?
I wanted to like Perl cause I love regex, but I definitely didn't. It felt like a mix of
PHP and Ruby, but way too much PHP for my love of Ruby to outweigh it

### If not, how hard was it to learn/setup?
Setup was easy, but learning was not intuitive since it all feels odd

## Thoughts on the Solution?
Part 1 was annoying cause I wrote and tested my solution based on the problem statement
and example, but neither explain how there can be multiple groups beyond the 3 shown in
the examples, so I more or less had to rewrite from scratch given how regex-heavy a Perl
solution will be

Part 2 was a little trickier
