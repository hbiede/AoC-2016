# Day 5 - Ruby

## Did I know this language before?
Yes

### What's your opinion of this language?
Ruby is so concise. I chose it because I had originally planned to use Objective-C, but it
didn't have an easy-access md5 function when ran in a scripting environment

### If not, how hard was it to learn/setup?
N/A

## Thoughts on the Solution?
Part 1 was easy to build

Part 2 the way of switching between the two is a bit gross, but it works
