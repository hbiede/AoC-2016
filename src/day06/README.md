# Day 6 - Objective-C

## Did I know this language before?
Unfortunately

### What's your opinion of this language?
Objective-C is a sad language that needs to die already. Especially with the square
brackets

### If not, how hard was it to learn/setup?
N/A

## Thoughts on the Solution?
Part 1 - hardest part was remembering the differences in function names between Swift and
Objective-C

Part 2 was a super easy switch with a couple ternaries
