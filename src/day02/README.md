# Day 2 - Prolog

## Did I know this language before?
Yes

### What's your opinion of this language?
It is rare that I write any Prolog, but I do actually enjoy it when I do

### If not, how hard was it to learn/setup?
N/A

## Thoughts on the Solution?
I am really happy with this solution, especially with the conciseness of the `find_move`
rule.
