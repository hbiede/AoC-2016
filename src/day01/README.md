# Day 1 - TI-Basic

## Did I know this language before?
Yes

### What's your opinion of this language?
Impossible to read or remember what the variables are

### If not, how hard was it to learn/setup?
N/A

## Thoughts on the Solution?
Part 1 was good

Part 2 was a trash pile due to a lack of decent data structures. Technically it could be
improved slightly by switching to forward tracking instead of backtracking at a certain
point, but writing that out would've taken longer than just running it.

**Note:** Running this yourself is impossible unless you want to type it into a calculator
manually. So trust me that I got 243 and 142 as my answers
